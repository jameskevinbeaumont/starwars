# About

This project was created using node.js for the server along with GraphQL. Dependencies on the server include: axios, concurrently, cors, dotenv, express, express-graphql, graphql, cross-env and nodemon. The project has been left in the "development" state meaning you can download and then start the project, which will start both the client and the server, with the command "npm run dev". I am using concurrently to allow for both the server and client to run using a single command and nodemon to allow for changes to the server without having to stop and restart the server.

React was used for the front-end client which included graphql and @apollo/client to access the data from the server. I have not used graphql before and have only used knex and bookshelf to access a SQL backend database or REST endpoints via axios. The styling is minimal though all points on the technical exercise have been addressed and the app is responsive at 1024 pixels and wider. I decided to leave the pagination at three people per page so the three cards are stacked on top of one another below 1024 and side by side 1024 and above. I used a simple pagination approach as the data being returned is not sizeable. There are many ways to handle pagination both on the client side or the server and although I looked into pagination on the server using graphql I decided to take the client side approach for this exercise. My pagination does allow for the user to navigate forward and backwards through the people returned from the query to SWAPI.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
